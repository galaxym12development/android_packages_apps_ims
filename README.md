# phhusson/ims — VoLTE for LineageOS on Samsung devices

Open-source SIP/IMS stack for LineageOS, based on [phhusson/ims](https://github.com/phhusson/ims).
Tested on Samsung Galaxy A21s (SM-A217F) running LineageOS 23.2 (Android 16) with O2 Germany.

## How it works

The Android telephony framework requires a privileged system app that implements
`android.telephony.ims.ImsService` and is registered as the MmTel provider. This app
provides a pure-userspace SIP/IMS stack: it opens the IMS bearer, discovers the P-CSCF,
performs SIP AKA registration, and handles voice calls over RTP.

## Prerequisites

After cloning (whether via `repo sync`, `git clone`, or roomservice), initialize
the `rnnoise` submodule — `repo sync` does not do this automatically:

```sh
cd packages/apps/PhhIms
git submodule update --init app/jni/rnnoise
```

## Building in-tree (LineageOS / AOSP)

Add this repo to your local manifest or `lineage.dependencies`:

```xml
<!-- .repo/local_manifests/roomservice.xml -->
<project path="packages/apps/PhhIms" remote="github" name="amikhasenko/ims" revision="main" />
```

```json
// lineage.dependencies
{
    "repository": "amikhasenko/ims",
    "target_path": "packages/apps/PhhIms",
    "branch": "main"
}
```

The `Android.bp` uses `platform_apis: true`, which gives access to all internal
framework APIs (`Rlog`, `MmTelFeature`, `ImsConfigImplBase`, etc.) without patching
`android.jar`. No Gradle build or SDK modification is needed.

## Device tree integration (Samsung Exynos example: A21s)

The following shows the full diff needed in your device tree. Adapt paths and package
names for your device.

If you have the same device, you can apply [the patch](./device_a21s_common.patch)
to [`device_a21s_common`](https://github.com/LineageOS/android_device_samsung_a21s-common) repository

## Required binary patches

The Samsung audio HAL (`libaudioproxy.so`) routes `AudioRecord` with source
`VOICE_COMMUNICATION` to the modem/baseband uplink PCM (`pcm110c`, `calliope_10`)
instead of the real microphone (`pcm12c`, `WDMA0`). During a software IMS call
there is no modem audio on this path, so the captured audio is silent.

The root cause is in `proxy_create_capture_stream`: the inner TBH6 table for
`stream_type=11` unconditionally sets `AUSAGE = 110` for **all** AudioSources that
map to that stream type (`MIC`, `CAMCORDER`, `VOICE_RECOGNITION`, `VOICE_COMMUNICATION`).

The fix is a **conditional hook** that checks `ausage_param` and routes only
`VOICE_COMMUNICATION`/`MIC` to the real mic, while keeping `CAMCORDER` and
`VOICE_RECOGNITION` on their original modem path. Full reverse-engineering notes
are in [RE/README.md](RE/README.md).

### Step 1 — Pull the binary from the device

```sh
cd RE/
bash scripts/pull_binaries.sh   # requires: adb root
```

This places `libaudioproxy.so` in `RE/binaries/`.

### Step 2 — Verify and apply the patch

```sh
# Verify current state
python3 RE/scripts/patch_ausage_stream_type_11.py verify

# Apply: writes RE/binaries/libaudioproxy_patched.so (original backed up as .so.backup)
python3 RE/scripts/patch_ausage_stream_type_11.py patch
```

### Step 3 — Push to device

Requires an unlocked bootloader and a userdebug build (so `adb root` and `adb remount` work):

```sh
adb root
adb remount
adb push RE/binaries/libaudioproxy_patched.so /vendor/lib/libaudioproxy.so
adb shell chmod 644 /vendor/lib/libaudioproxy.so
adb shell stop audioserver && sleep 2 && adb shell start audioserver
```

Note: `/vendor` is mounted as an overlay on erofs. Changes do not persist across
reboots unless you re-push the patched binary after each boot, or make it
persistent via a Magisk module or boot script.

## Required framework patches

### `packages/services/Telecomm` — use `MODE_IN_COMMUNICATION` instead of `MODE_IN_CALL`

The Samsung audio HAL treats `MODE_IN_CALL` specially: it reconfigures any active primary
capture stream to the baseband uplink PCM path (`/dev/snd/pcmC0D110c`), which taps the
hardware circuit-switched voice path and produces silence for software IMS stacks that do
their own RTP encoding.  Switching to `MODE_IN_COMMUNICATION` keeps the microphone on the
real ADC path.

| Incoming Calls | Fix for "dropped after accept" committed; needs device verification |
| Outgoing Calls | **Works** with the `libaudioproxy.so` conditional hook patch + Telecom `MODE_IN_COMMUNICATION` patch |
| Mic audio during call | **Works** with conditional hook patch (routes `VOICE_COMMUNICATION` to real mic `pcm12c`) |

## Building with Gradle

The public `android.jar` (API 33) stubs do not expose the internal IMS APIs. To build
with Gradle you need a full `android.jar` built from AOSP sources in `app/libs/android.jar`,
and the SDK jar must have `MmTelFeature` removed to avoid duplicate class conflicts:

```sh
zip -d ./platforms/android-33/android.jar \
    android/telephony/ims/feature/MmTelFeature.class \
    'android/telephony/ims/feature/MmTelFeature$MmTelCapabilities.class'
```

For production builds use the in-tree Soong build instead.

## Notes

- The app has no launcher icon and does not appear in the app drawer.
- On carriers where the RIL does not report P-CSCF addresses via `LinkProperties`,
  DNS discovery is attempted using the standard 3GPP domain (TS 23.003 §13.2):
  `ims.mnc<MNC>.mcc<MCC>.3gppnetwork.org`. A last-resort override is available via
  `adb shell setprop persist.ims.pcscf_fallback <ip>`.
- VoLTE must be enabled via ADB once after installing:
  ```
  adb shell settings put global enhanced_4g_mode_enabled 1
  ```
  On a fresh install this defaults to on.
